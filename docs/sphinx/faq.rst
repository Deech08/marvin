Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How do I update marvin?
-----------------------

Just do ``pip install --upgrade sdss-marvin``. Marvin will get updated to the latest
version, along with all the dependencies. If you want to update marvin but keep other
packages in their currrent versions, do
``pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy only-if-needed sdss-marvin``. This will only
update dependencies if marvin does need it.


How do report a bug/request a feature?
--------------------------------------

As Marvin is on Github, we recommend submitting a `Github Issue <https://github.com/sdss/marvin/issues/new>`_.
