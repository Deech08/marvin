Acknowledging and Citing Marvin
-------------------------------



In Publications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use Marvin (including the `web interface <https://dr15.sdss.org/marvin>`_) for work/research presented in a publication (whether directly, or as a dependency to another package), we ask that you cite the `Marvin Software <https://zenodo.org/record/596700>`_. We provide the following as a standard acknowledgment you can use if there is not a specific place to cite the DOI:

    *This research made use of Marvin, a core Python package and web framework for MaNGA data, developed by Brian Cherinka,
    José Sánchez-Gallego, Brett Andrews, and Joel Brownstein. (MaNGA Collaboration, 2018).*
